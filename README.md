## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Piotr and I love coding :)
My language of choice is Rust.
Currently using Pop_OS! with COSMIC DE.

#### Projects I'm trying to keep alive are:
- [Quick Web Apps](https://github.com/cosmic-utils/web-apps)
- [cosmic-ext-applet-ollama](https://github.com/cosmic-utils/cosmic-ext-applet-ollama)

and also I would like to finish my kdeconnect implementation in Rust:
- [kdeconnect](https://github.com/hepp3n/kdeconnect)

and then release
- [cosmic-ext-applet-connect](https://github.com/hepp3n/cosmic-ext-applet-connect)

I don't have full time job, so I'm living with my passion. 
If you like what I'm doing, please consider supporting me!

:)
